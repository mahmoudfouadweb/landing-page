# Landing Page Project

# technology's used  in project

1- i made the navigation bar dynamicly by using forEach method
and i tell it to create for every single section a list Item and an anchor <a> and have a text content named from data-nav attribute's value
and used addEventListener by click and scrollIntoView and made the behavior is "smooth" by Javascript not by css method  

2- i used for highlight sections when scrolling a intersection observer method and add,remove class named "active"
and made foreach function for booth section and nav bar items and linked them with data-nav attribute by data-nav value

3- i  modified css file a background-color babyBlue and font color yellow to active nav bar item

4- i made the class attribute to the active element for <section> and <a> named class="active" not class="your-active-class"

# Usability:

it's done can any modern devise use all features
## Styling

i modified the stylesheet and add a property to html element  to make the scroll smooth, add cursor pointer method to <li> to be like a link and some margin between them

## HTML Structure 
i add a 4 sections by HTML and modified the section and add another paragraph contain lorem, the target only has a 'active' class dynamicly

# Landing Page Behavior

## Navigation
Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list.
made a four list items via Javascript and add the section name and section  dynamically and linked it to her section and when active the nav item will be highlighted in blue 

## Section Active State
i used intersection observer method and made a loop for each section and nav items
included entry parameter and threshold option and isIntersecting property
